    "\n",
    "- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way."

    "### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose."
